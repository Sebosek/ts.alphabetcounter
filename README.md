# ts.alphabetcounter

This is another interview test. 
The goal is create Excel like counter - excel is using alphabetical characters in columns and if you use more than 26 columns Excel adds an 'A' lette and starts over and continue in this way.
At interview I was using C# language but I decided to write TypeScript version also.
