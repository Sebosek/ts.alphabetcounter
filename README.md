# ts.alphabetcounter

This is another test at interview.

> The goal is create Excel like counter - excel is using alphabetical characters in columns and if you use more than 26 columns Excel adds an 'A' letter at the beginning and starts over and continue in this way.

At interview I was using C# language but I decided to write TypeScript version also.
